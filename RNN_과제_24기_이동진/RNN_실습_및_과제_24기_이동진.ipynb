        "A2.LSTM의 핵심 아이디어는 이전 단계의 정보를 Memory cell에 저장해서 흘려보내는 것입니다. 현재 시점의 정보를 바탕으로 과거 정보를 얼마나 잊을지를 정해주고 이에 현재의 정보를 더하여 다음 시점으로 정보를 전달하는 구조를 통해 장기 의존성 문제를 해결합니다.각 구조를 간단하게 살펴보면 먼저 Forget Gate에서는 현시점의 정보, 과거 은닉층의 값에 다른 가중치를 곱하여 더한 후 sigmoid함수를 거쳐 이 값을 전 cell에 곱해줍니다. Input gate에서는 candidate가 얼마나 중요한지를 반영하여 cell에 기록합니다. 이후 memory cell단계에서는 과거 정보를 Forget gate에서 계산된만큼 잊고 candidate에 input gate에서의 중요도를 곱해 곱해 계산합니다. 마지막으로 Output gate에서는 memory cell을 현시점의 은닉층의 값으로 출력할 양을 결정합니다. 직관적으로 생각하면 특정 정보가 입력되었을 때 그것이 유의미할때까지 기억하고, 필요없게 되면 잊어버려 현재의 정보와 더하여 정확하게 출력을 도출하게 됩니다. 이를 통해 RNN에서 문제점으로 지적되었던 장기 의존성 문제를 해결하게 됩니다."
